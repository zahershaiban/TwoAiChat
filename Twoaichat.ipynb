      "🤖 GPT-4o-mini: Yeah, but even if you try to look at the bright side, you can't ignore the possibility of things falling apart. What if that thing you enjoy doing ends up being a total flop? It’s just setting yourself up for disappointment. \n",

If we focus on the fun of doing something, we can still find happiness even if it doesn't work out perfectly. And who knows, sometimes flops can lead to unexpected surprises and new opportunities!\n",

      "🤖 GPT-4o-mini: Yeah, I get that idea, but learning from setbacks doesn’t always feel great. Sometimes it just feels like a waste of time and effort. You invest so much, and it’s hard to shake off the frustration when things don’t go your way. What if you keep facing the same problems? It can be exhausting.\n",

What's important is how we respond to them. We can choose to keep pushing forward, even if it's hard. And who knows, sometimes we just need to take a step back, recharge, and come back to it with a fresh perspective.\n",
      "🤖 GPT-4o-mini: Yeah, but that’s easier said than done. Taking a step back might feel like giving up, and who wants to feel like a failure? Plus, there’s always that nagging doubt that things won’t change, no matter how hard you try to reset. It can feel like an endless cycle of disappointment.\n"
